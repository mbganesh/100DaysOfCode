# 100DaysOfCode
Challenge Start from April 1.

#Day-1
**Overview of Algorithm**
- Asymptotic Analysis
- B.A.W Case
- Big O Notation
- Linear Search

_Analysis of Algorith: Asymptotic Analysis - Used for compare two algorithms literally nor preferred. Cases - Best , average , best cases. Notation - Big O notation used for find out the algorithm speed and best way to descipe compare algos. Linear Search - Easy to implement but worst time complexity_
